| **Category**                    | **Criteria**                                                                                                                                 | **Points** |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **1. Requirements Analysis**   | Clear and complete table of system requirements derived from the background problem statement. Requirements should include functional and non-functional aspects. | **15**     |
| **2. System Architecture Design** | Well-structured n-tier architecture clearly showing separation of concerns (e.g., presentation, logic, data). Includes system components such as IoT layer, API/data access layer, database, and front-end. | **20**     |
| **3. Component Descriptions**  | Each component (e.g., database, API, front-end, sensors/controllers) is described with its purpose, interactions, and role in the architecture. | **15**     |
| **4. Cloud Hosting Strategy**  | Hosting choices are justified and align with scalability, cost-efficiency, and performance. Identifies which cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) will be used for each component. | **15**     |
| **5. Alerting and Monitoring Strategy** | Includes details about thresholds, alert delivery (e.g., email), and failover detection for offline sensors or system delays. | **10**     |
| **6. Scalability and Extensibility** | Solution accounts for future expansion (e.g., more sensors, apps). Demonstrates understanding of scaling components independently. | **10**     |
| **7. Presentation & Clarity**  | Design is clearly communicated through well-organized text and visuals. Diagrams (e.g., architecture or data flow) are neat and support understanding. | **10**     |
| **8. Completeness & Creativity** | Meets all assignment instructions. Thoughtful recommendations or enhancements (e.g., mobile optimization, cloud cost strategies). | **5**      |
